But if you need some Ubuntu extra package which required root access you could install using:

```

Note: that if you upgrade Jupyter Notebook Docker Desktop Extension above post installations steps must be re-done.

Adding this kernel is easy, just right after the extension is installed by excuting in a terminal:

```bash
